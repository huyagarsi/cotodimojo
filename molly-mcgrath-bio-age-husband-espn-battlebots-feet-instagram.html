I’m like that [bygone] bar in downtown Boston, Jose McIntyre’s.</p><p><strong>It seems like you always had a laser-like focus on becoming a sportscaster. Since what age, and why?</strong>&nbsp;Since I was a little girl, watching Giants games with my dad. I knew I wanted to work in sports and to be in television, but I didn’t have the laser-like focus until I was in college. At BC, I got internships and saw the passion of the Boston fan base. I thought, “This drives people absolutely crazy, and it scares me a little bit—but if it gets people this worked up, it’s something I have to do.”</p><p><strong>Do you ever get sick of talking about sports?</strong>No, especially because I have AL and NL teams, AFC and NFC teams. I’m a Giants fan and a Red Sox fan, a 49ers fan and a Patriots fan. So I have a lot of teams to root for and games to watch.</p><p><strong>So it’s all sports, all the time?</strong>No. Sometimes, there’s nothing better than coming home and watching HGTV. That’s my guilty pleasure, watching the fixer-upper, house-hunter-type shows. It gives my mind a bit of a break.</p><p><strong>Do you ever miss basketball?</strong>I do. I really miss it, and I’m so pumped that the season is back. But Fox doesn’t have rights to any NBA games. Maybe I’ll get to do college basketball once we get into it.</p><p><strong>Should gillette stadium be closer to boston?</strong>[Laughs] I think Bostonians think so. The people of Foxborough probably wouldn’t be thrilled. But yeah, it’s a pain getting out there. There’s nothing like that cold wind hitting your face, though, and not being able to feel your entire body just screams Patriots game.</p><p><strong>So what do you think you get stereotyped about the most in your career?&nbsp;</strong>It’s tough being a woman in sports. You may not always be taken seriously. You have to work twice as hard, and your margin for error is twice as small.</p><p><strong>Ever feel patronized by players?</strong> No. But there have been coaches that I’ve crossed at times and other people in the industry. Fox is really good at giving me a voice, though. They know what i’m passionate about, and they let me speak about it. Not a lot of women in sports really have a voice. I’m really fortunate that fox gives that to me.</p><p><strong>How do you project authority when someone’s speaking down to you?&nbsp;</strong>You just smile and ask kickass questions and show that you know what you’re talking about. You do your homework. Respect is something that has to be earned.</p><p><strong>Do you get carded every single time you order a glass of wine?&nbsp;</strong>[laughs] not so much anymore. I’m 25 now!</p><p><strong>What team has your favorite fans?</strong>&nbsp;One of the reasons I got into this business was that I saw how crazy Boston fans are. There’s nothing like going to a Pats game and have complete strangers run up to you and high-five you when they score. I would have to say that Boston fans are probably the wildest that I’ve come across.</p><p><strong>When it comes to football—college or pro?</strong>Oh, that’s tough. I would have to say college. I love watching the NFL, and I loved working in it. But I love working in college football, because the fan base is really invested. They’re really nuts. They’re all there on Saturday to watch their classmates play or cheer for their alma mater. I also love covering college football because I can lie in bed all day Sunday and watch the NFL.</p><p><strong>So you don’t want to cover it anymore?</strong> It’s not that. I covered the NFL last season. I’d just say covering college football is a little more exciting. These kids are fighting for a career. They’re not getting paid. They’re doing it for school pride and because their family and friends are watching. I’ve done so many interviews after games. With the NFL, I never saw tears, and I’ve probably seen tears three times already this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1forytuNhmpJyfopbBqXnBoqZmmZeaeqnB0puYp5xdmsCxuoybmK2snJqvsMDSZp2enaRitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-nanny-nicole-to-the-rescue-eric-declares-sloan-unfit-to-raise-baby-jude.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nanny Nicole to the Rescue, Eric Declares Sloan Unfit to Raise Baby Jude?</a>
