The Kardashian family is of Armenian nationality on patriarch Robert Kardashian's side and Dutch, English, Irish, German, and Scottish on Kris Jenner's side. Robert Kardashian and Kris Houghton got married on July 8, 1978. He is best known for representing O.J. Simpson in his murder trial of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. They have four children: Kourtney was born in 1979, Kim in 1980, Khloe in 1984, and Rob Jr. in 1987. Robert and Kris divorced in 1991. They remained close friends until his death in 2003 from esophageal cancer.</p><p>Kris married retired Olympic decathlon athlete Bruce Jenner in April 1991, just one month after her divorce from Robert Kardashian became final. Bruce came out as a transgender woman in 2015 and is now Caitlyn Jenner. Kris and Caitlyn have two daughters: Kendall born in 1995 and Kylie, born in 1997.</p><p>The family has been featured on the E! reality television series "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" (and its various spinoffs) since October 2007. The family was estimated to make $65 million in 2010. They signed a deal with E! to keep the show on the air for three more years in 2012 for $40 million. It is said that they earned $10 million per season of the show. The show continued into 2021 with its 20th season and a total of 293 episodes.</p><p>After leaving the E! Network for Hulu, the family returned to television with their new reality series, "The Kardashians," in 2022.</p><h2 id=robert-kardashian-sr-net-worth><strong><a href=#>Robert Kardashian Sr net worth</a>: $30 million</strong></h2><p>The late Robert Kardashian was born in Los Angeles in 1944.

Kardashian went to law school at the University of San Diego. He practiced law for a decade before founding "Radio & Records," a trade publication in 1973. He sold the publication for a considerable profit in 1979. Kardashian also came up with the idea of playing music as filler in movie theaters. The idea proved to be profitable, and he started a company called Movie Tunes based on this premise. Robert Kardashian then connected with his old friend from college, <a href=# title="OJ Simpson Net Worth">OJ Simpson</a>, to start a frozen yogurt company called Juice, Inc. They eventually started a music video production company called Concert Cinema. During this time, the Kardashian family and the Simpson family became extremely close, and a sense of loyalty was established between the two households.

Then, in 1994, Simpson allegedly murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman and Simpson turned to his old college friend for representation in the murder trial. Robert died on September 30, 2003.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner-net-worth-170><strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner net worth:</a> $170 million</strong></h2><p>In 2007, Kris Jenner had an idea.

Seacrest had his own production company and sent a cameraman to capture the family in their natural habitat home life. He reviewed the footage and decided to move forward with the project, keeping the popular MTV show "The Osbournes" in mind as an inspiration. From there, "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" was born. The show was picked up E! entertainment network, and Jenner moved forward as executive producer. The show highlights the drama that comes with having a blended, celebrity family and many children of similar ages. It also focuses on the business ventures and personal lives of the Kardashian and Jenner kids.
