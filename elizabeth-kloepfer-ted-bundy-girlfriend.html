In the fall of 1969, 24-year-old Kendall was working as a secretary at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Bundy started school at the University of Washington in 1966, but he dropped out in 1968 before returning in the fall of 1969.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Kendall was a divorced single mom, and according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/ted-bundy-elizabeth-kloepfer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Biography.com class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Biography.com</a>, she described herself as "shy, insecure and lonely" in her book.

Kendall wrote that after getting home, she "was so sick, all I could do was take my shoes off and fall into bed. Ted, still dressed, lying down next to me, then the room turning wildly." The next morning, Bundy made breakfast for Kendall and her daughter.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Kendall and Bundy's relationship was turbulent.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The relationship moved very quickly, and that was partly because Kendall wanted a father figure for her three-year-old daughter. "Talking and eating and taking care of [my daughter] and sleeping together all flowed along so effortlessly that we had become a family," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6625223/The-woman-loved-Ted-Bundy-Divorcee-mom-dated-notorious-serial-killer-decade.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she wrote" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">she wrote</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">But underneath that happy family facade were some serious cracks. Around 1970, the couple decided to get married, and they went to a courthouse to get their marriage license. But since Kendall's parents were due to visit a couple of days, she asked Bundy to temporarily move his stuff out the apartment that they shared so that her conservative parents wouldn't be upset that they were living together. Bundy became angry, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.oxygen.com/martinis-murder/did-ted-bundy-have-kids-got-girlfriend-elizabeth-kloepfer-pregnant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Oxygen" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">according to Oxygen</a> he told Kendall, "You’re a grown woman, Liz.

Kendall and Bundy lived together during many of the years that he was committing his crimes, but it took Kendall a while to figure out exactly what was going on.

Public fear started to increase as more women went missing, but law enforcement didn't have a clear description of the suspect and there was little physical evidence to tie anyone to the crimes.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.menshealth.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=instagram style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# aria-label="View full post on Instagram" class="css-0 e1c1bym14">View full post on Instagram</a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In July 1974, two women went missing at the Lake Sammamish State Park in King County, Washington. Witnesses later said that the women had been seen talking to a man who introduced himself as "Ted," who drove a Volkswagen Beetle. From the witnesses' descriptions, police were able to put together a description and sketch of the suspect. Kendall realized that the sketch looked eerily similar to her boyfriend, and she decided to contact the police and told them to look into Bundy. The police brushed off Kendall's tip, as they didn't think that a well-spoken, unassuming man like Bundy would be a serial killer.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">But even after tipping off the police about his behavior, Kendall continued to date Bundy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Kendall wasn't really sure if Bundy was truly a murderer. "In my own mind, there were coincidences that seemed to tie him it, yet when I would think about or day-to-day relationship there was nothing there that would lead me to think that he was a violent man capable of doing something like that," she said in an interview with police, as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1010464/the-serial-killer-and-the-women-who-loved-him-dissecting-ted-bundy-s-three-defining-relationships data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E!

Bundy dated even more women while he was in Utah, and he killed at least five women during that time. In November, when Kendall realized that women were disappearing in the Salt Lake City area, she contacted the police and sat down for an interview with Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the King County, Washington police—and Bundy started to look like a serious suspect to authorities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Kendall contacted them again a month later, but since there was no concrete evidence to link him to the crimes, not much happened. Bundy continued to commit crimes in Utah, Colorado, and Idaho throughout 1974 and 1975, while still continuing his relationship with Kendall, who never told him that she had contacted the police on three separate occasions.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Kendall eventually helped the police arrest Bundy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In August 1975, Bundy was arrested in Utah after he sped away from a police car. Sgt. Bob Hayward had observed Bundy cruising a residential area around 3 a.m., and Bundy had fled the neighborhood after seeing Hayward.

He was placed in a line-up and DaRonch identified him immediately. He was charged with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in October, and was freed on a $15,000 bail that was paid by his parents.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Kendall stuck by Bundy during his trial, arrest, and escapes from prison.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Kendall and Bundy continued to live together as he awaited trial. In February 1976, the trial for the DaRonch kidnapping started, and Bundy was declared guilty on March 1. On June 30, Bundy was sentenced to a minimum of one year and a maximum 15 years in the Utah State Prison.

He didn’t ask me why or what I told the police and I didn’t ask him about his connection to the crimes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Kendall and Bundy continued to write letters to each other while he was locked up, and she visited him twice in his Utah prison before he was charged with the murder of Caryn Campbell in October 1976. He was transferred to the Garfield County Jail in Greenwood Springs, Colorado in January 1977. In June 1977, he escaped from the Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen, and he was captured after six days.<br></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.menshealth.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=instagram style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# aria-label="View full post on Instagram" class="css-0 e1c1bym14">View full post on Instagram</a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">On December 30, Bundy escaped from the Garfield County Jail, and he had reportedly hinted at his plans for escape in letters to Kendall. He was able to make it to Chicago, Michigan, Atlanta, and then Florida. In January 1978, he attacked five students from the Florida State University, killing two. In February, he killed 12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach, his youngest victim (Leach was coincidentally the same age as Kendall's daughter at the time).<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Kendall didn’t hear from Bundy until he was finally captured on February 15, 1978 and additionally charged with murder and rape. In one of their last conversations he explained why he had been so hot and cold with her. He confessed that he tried to stay away from Kendall when he "felt the power of his sickness building in him."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">He also confessed that he had once tried to kill her by closing the fireplace damper and putting a towel in the door crack so the smoke would stay in their apartment.

She expressed disbelief, shock, and disgust over what Bundy had done, but she also believed that a part of her would probably always love him. "In spite of all the destruction he has caused around him, I still care what happens to Ted. I have come to accept that a part of me will always love a part of him," she wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The preface to her book is dedicated to Bundy's victims. "Never did I forget that real women had been murdered for no other reason than they were attractive and friendly. The hideous reality of their deaths became my reality, too. Their tragedy was my trauma…I am thankful to have survived, thankful for the chance to work my problems through, thankful for the resiliency God gives humans."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Bundy eventually confessed to many of his crimes, and he was executed in 1989 at the Florida State Prison.</p><img alt="Fraternity Celebrating Death of Ted Bundy" title="Fraternity Celebrating Death of Ted Bundy" width=3747 height=2081 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/florida-state-universitys-chi-phi-fraternity-celebrates-the-news-photo-515325576-1556901127.jpg><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-xjwzcs e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span>Florida State University’s Chi Phi fraternity celebrates the execution of Ted Bundy.<h2 data-node-id=44 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Kendall later retired from public life.<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Not much is known about her exact whereabouts, but Kendall has recovered from her alcohol addiction and is living in Washington state, as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a27331081/where-is-ted-bundy-girlfriend-elizabeth-kloepfer-liz-kendall-today/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Cosmopolitan class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Cosmopolitan</a> reports.
