A lot has been revealed about <a href=#>what happened behind the scenes</a>, with the <a href=#>friendship between the main cast</a> usually being a popular talking point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show has had <a href=#>a failed spin-off</a> in the past, and it's going back to the well once more for That '90s Show.</p><p>Following the first look at the show, conversation was ablaze, and we have some details on what fans have expressed below!</p><h2 id=39-that-39-70s-show-39-was-a-major-hit-years-back>'That '70s Show' Was A Major Hit Years Back</h2><p>In 1998, Fox struck gold with That '70s Show, a sitcom focused on teens growing up in 1970s Wisconsin. A simple premise, sure, but the show's retro vibe, as well as its relatable themes and dynamic cast were the catalyst for the show's massive success.</p><p>The young stars of the show might have been unknown when they were cast, but their on-screen chemistry was otherworldly. The show could have been a success with others in place, but what the cast did with the material they were given helped take the show to another level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For 8 seasons and 200 episodes, That '70s Show was a force on TV, and people still enjoy watching it to this very day.</p><p>In what came as a surprise development for many, the franchise will be continuing with a fresh spin-off series that's set to bring back some familiar faces.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Replacing Laurie On That 70s Show Was Huge For Christina Moore's Career</a></span></p><h2 id=39-that-39-90s-show-39-is-its-newest-spin-off-project>'That '90s Show' Is Its Newest Spin-Off Project</h2><p>That '90s Show is the new series from the folks behind the original, and for Millennials, this is the show that officially makes them feel old. After all, they grew up on the original, and now, they're the ones being examined through a retro lens by younger audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, this is not the first time that the franchise tried rolling the dice on a spin-off show. Years back, That '80s Show tried and failed to captivate audiences. It was completely disconnected from the original, and after a single season, which consisted of 13 episodes, it was canceled and completely forgotten about, minus being a piece of trivia for It's Always Sunny actor, Glenn Howerton.</p><p>For That '90s Show, a major selling point is that it will be continuing on with the Forman clan. As far as what it's about, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> wrote, "Set in Wisconsin in 1995, That ’90s Show follows Leia Forman, daughter of Eric and Donna, who is visiting her grandparents for the summer and bonds with a new generation of Point Place kids under the watchful eye of Kitty and the stern glare of Red."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That sounds promising, but at the end of the day, the folks making the show need to deliver the goods. If they drop the ball, this series will simply go the way of other projects that tried and failed at resurrecting a classic from yesteryear.</p><p>As we've inched closer to its official release, we've gotten a first look at the show, which has caused quite the conversation across the web.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Tragic Final Days Of That '70s Show Star Lisa Robin Kelly</a></span></p><h2 id=what-fans-are-saying-about-the-first-look-for-that-39-90s-show>What Fans Are Saying About The First Look For That '90s Show?</h2><p>So, what are people saying about the first look at That '90s Show? Well, as you'd imagine, the reaction has been polarizing.</p><p>One fan on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> pointed out the show's initial tone, which contrasts the original.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This seems more.... Disney Channel than the original if that makes sense?," they wrote.</p><p>Another fan was blunt with their initial take.</p><p>"I’m gonna be honest that uhh.. doesn’t look great," they stated.</p><p>One user gave a sprinkle of optimism, all while highlighting the failure of That '80s Show.</p><p>"It can't be any worse than that 80s show. At least this has Red and Kitty as the main," they said.</p><p>A mixed bag of reactions so far, but that's to be expected. Within these reactions, a frequent talking point of the show not looking or feeling like the '90s has come up more than a few times, and that's pretty understandable.</p><p>The decade was quite unique, and this show's initial look feels a bit like cosplaying, as opposed to feeling like the decade that gave us Super Nintendo and "The Macarena".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Laura Prepon Caused A Delay During The That 70s Show Series Finale</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That '90s Show will debut on Netflix in January, and many will tune in to see how the show holds up to the original. Will it get a new generation of kids hanging out in the Forman's basement, or will it send people for the hills like That '80s Show? Guess we'll find out soon enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiutJmmKudXaiuurXNoGSamp%2BqwW7Ax55kn6GiqMFuuM6oomaZpGLBqa3TZnBpq12otbDDjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-the-difference-between-zego-and-inshur.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is the Difference Between Zego and INSHUR</a>
