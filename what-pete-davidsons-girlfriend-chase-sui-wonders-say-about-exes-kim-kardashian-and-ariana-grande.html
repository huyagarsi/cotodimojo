And that must have included Chase Sui Wonders since the two met on the set of the A24 horror movie and began dating a while after that. But has Pete Davidson's girlfriend commented on the fact that he has two incredibly famous ex-girlfriends?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pete-davidson-and-kim-kardashian.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wonders doesn't appear to have said anything. She and Davidson haven't confirmed that they are in a relationship. But that isn't unusual as Davidson can sometimes be quiet and coy about who he's dating. He seems to talk about his personal life when he feels ready.</p><p>When compared to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Pete Davidson's</a> other partners, especially Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande, Chase Sui Wonders might be the most private. She isn't a member of an incredibly famous family known for having every move chronicled on a reality show. And she isn't a massively successful pop star, either.</p><p>Wonders is a quiet actress whose career has been slowly picking up speed over the past few years. She doesn't have many credits to her name. She starred on the teen series Generation, appeared in Sofia Coppola's 2020 movie On The Rocks, and played an actress named Emma in Bodies Bodies Bodies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pete-davidson-chase-sui-wonders.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wonders is active on Instagram, letting her followers know when she has a new movie or TV show to talk about. She plays the main character Samantha on the AppleTV+ series City on Fire, which has a unique concept. The show follows the aftermath of Samantha's murder and how the people around her look into what happened.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Why Fans Really Want Pete Davidson To Still Be In Love With Ariana Grande</a></span></p><p>While Wonders will post about where she has traveled, like her Mexico trip in September 2022 and her Paris vacation in October 2022, she doesn't seem to post about who she is dating. Since Davidson and Wonders have been linked, there are no photos of them together on her social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pete-davidson-ariana-grande.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The one exception is one Instagram video that Wonders posted in April 2023 promoting Bupkis, the TV show that she is starring in alongside Davidson. She wrote in the caption, "BUPKIS BLASTOFF" and said "dream team comin 4 u May 4th." The cast of Bupkis, which is a Peacock series, also includes hilarious stars Charlie Day, Brad Garrett, and Ray Ramono. The series is based on Pete Davidson's experiences but will likely take some liberties.</p><p>Chase Sui Wonders seems like a very self-assured and confident actress. There's no doubt that some people would be intimidated by knowing that their partner has dated some very famous people. Reading the many stories about those relationships must be tough and strange. But perhaps Wonders is cool with it and chooses to focus on her acting jobs and her relationship with Davidson rather than dwelling on his romantic past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-pete-davidson-and-chase-sui-wonders-39-s-relationship-like>What Is Pete Davidson And Chase Sui Wonders's Relationship Like?</h2><p>According to People, fans noticed that Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders might be dating in December 2022.
