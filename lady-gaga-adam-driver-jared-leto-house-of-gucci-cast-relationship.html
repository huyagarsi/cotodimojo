Especially when it comes to<a href=#><strong> Lady Gaga</strong></a>. While<a href=#> Lady Gaga's House of Gucci premiere outfit</a> turned heads, she is also getting a ton of accolades for her performance in the film. Of course, she's also got a ton of attention for her choice of going method to bring the main character to life. Alongside her in that approach was co-star Jared Leto. But the "Edge Of Glory" singer spent most of the Ridley Scott film acting across the Adam Driver.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Lady Gaga Really Feels About 'House Of Gucci'</a></span></p><p>Given the obsession that fans have with <a href=#>what really happened between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper</a> on the set of A Star Is Born, they are equally as curious about her relationship with Adam. After all, their chemistry in House of Gucci was nothing short of electric. But no two movie sets are the same. So, did Lady Gaga actually get along with the man who played her love interest? What about the other actor who went method on the movie? Did that cause conflicts behind the scenes? Here's the truth about Lady Gaga's relationship with both Adam Driver and Jared Leto...</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-and-jared-leto-share-the-same-acting-method>Lady Gaga And Jared Leto Share The Same Acting Method</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with FabTV</a> discussing the making of Hosue Of Gucci, Lady Gaga shed light on how she felt working with Academy Award-winner Jared Leto.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I loved working with Jared. He was wonderful on set. He was so committed to his role. I appreciate him very much because I also like to not break character. So we had a lot of fun together not breaking character," Lady Gaga told FabTV. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Lady Gaga explained that she and Jared enjoyed bouncing off one another and improvising, including the famous "Father, Son, and House of Gucci" moment.</p><p>Lady Gaga went on to say that she felt Jared's performance in Hosue of Gucci was "very brave" and sympathized with how difficult it can be to perform when covered in prosthetics. She told FabTV that she too had to use prosthetics while making her "Born This Way" video and it was a grueling experience for her. With all the uncomfortable prosthetics as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared's less-than-stellar reputation</a>, especially as far as his method acting is concerned, one would suspect that he was challenging to deal with onset. But this wasn't Lady Gaga's experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Wearing prostehtics] can be very claustrophobic and he really worked through, I think, so much to make his character come to life and he also was equally loving to everybody around him."</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-absolutely-worships-adam-driver>Lady Gaga Absolutely Worships Adam Driver</h2><p>"I loved working with Adam. I think he's one of the most brilliant actors on the Earth. I think he has a way of approaching a script that's unapparelled. He's both emotional and academic. He's both intellectual as well as deeply visceral," Lady Gaga said to FabTV. "I loved getting to know him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lady Gaga Drove By The Place Maurizio Gucci Was Assassinated And Felt Like The Perpetrator</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her interview with FabTV, Lady Gaga also said that she appreciated that Adam "made space" for her given that she was method acting and he wasn't. In fact, she said that he upheld that part of her while they were working together, which seems like a lot of work.</p><p>Not only does Lady Gaga openly state that she adores Adam Driver as a person, but it couldn't be clearer from her body language in her various press conferences and interviews with him. Of course, the two actors, who could both be up for Academy Awards in the common months, have spent a lot of time together doing press. During these interviews, the two always seem comfortable and friendly with one another. Much of this could be due to the fact that they spent 2 weeks in rehearsal prior to going into production on House of Gucci.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lady Gaga Sings Praises To Her Icon Britney Spears Amid Her Conservatorship Ending</a></span></p><p>The pair did not know each other before making the movie. But really got to know each other after the filming concluded. Of course, it's unlikely that Adam really got to know Lady Gaga during filming as she was constantly in character. But it seems as though she really got to know him during the process. And what she discovered, she really adored. While they have very different approaches to their work and have very different backgrounds, the two found real authentic chemistry while working together and respect for each other's unflinching dedication to the work.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Billie Eilish And Lady Gaga Emerge As Business Moguls With New Product Lines</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmpypYrSis8BmmJ2ZnWKxs7XVnqlmopGnsqV5y56rqGWYpMK0sYyonWafpZiwqnnCmqqtZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-derrico-johnson-18-justin-johnson-dc-shooting-charges.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Derrico Johnson, 18?
