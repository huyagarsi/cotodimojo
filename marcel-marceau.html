his expressive gestures and silent comedy.</strong></p><p>But behind his famous white face and striped shirt, there was a courageous man who risked his life to save hundreds of Jewish children from the <a href=#>Nazis</a> during World War II.</p><p>In this article, I will explore the remarkable story of Marcel Marceau, his cause of death, his wives, movie roles, and legacy.</p><h2><span id=Marcel_Marceau_Cause_of_Death>Marcel Marceau Cause of Death</span></h2><p>Marcel Marceau died on September 22, 2007, at the age of 84, in a retirement home in Cahors, France.</p><p>His former assistant, Alexander Neander, announced his death to the media, but did not reveal the cause.</p><p>According to some unconfirmed reports, <strong>Marceau died of a heart attack following a long illness.</strong></p><p>He had retired from performing in 2005, after six decades of entertaining millions of people with his art of silence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/marcel2.jpg><h2><span id=Marcel_Marceau_Wife>Marcel Marceau Wife</span></h2><p>Marceau was married three times in his life.</p><p><strong>His first wife was Huguette Mallette</strong>, a Canadian dancer whom he met in 1949.</p><p>They had two sons, Michel and Baptiste, and divorced in 1958.</p><p><strong>His second wife was Ella Jaroszewicz</strong>, a French-Polish choreographer who collaborated with him on many of his shows.</p><p>They married in 1966, but separated before 1975.</p><p><strong>His third and last wife was Anne Sicco</strong>, a journalist and author who wrote a biography of Marceau.</p><p>They married in 1975 and had two daughters, Camille and Aurélia.</p><h2><span id=Marcel_Marceau_and_Emma>Marcel Marceau and Emma</span></h2><p>One of the most popular movies about Marcel Marceau is <a href=#>Resistance</a>, a 2020 biographical drama directed by Jonathan Jakubowicz.</p><p>The film stars Jesse Eisenberg as Marceau, and Clémence Poésy as Emma, a local girl from Strasbourg who falls in love with him.</p><p>Emma and her sister Mila are part of a group of Jewish activists who rescue orphans from the Nazis and smuggle them to Switzerland.</p><p>Marceau joins them and uses his mime skills to keep the children quiet and entertained during their dangerous journey.</p><p>However, the film is not entirely based on true events.</p><p>Emma and Mila are fictional characters, created for the purpose of the story.</p><p>Marceau’s family publicly disavowed the film, stating that they had no involvement with its production and that it was misleading to present it as a true story.</p><h2><span id=Marcel_Marceau_Age>Marcel Marceau Age</span></h2><p><strong>Marcel Marceau was born on March 22, 1923, in Strasbourg, France, to a Jewish family.</strong></p><p>His original name was Marcel Mangel, and his father was a kosher butcher from Poland.</p><p>His mother was from Ukraine, and through her family, he was a cousin of Israeli singer Yardena Arazi.</p><p>When he was four years old, his family moved to Lille, but later returned to Strasbourg.</p><p>He was fascinated by mime and comedy since he was a child, and was inspired by Charlie Chaplin and Jean-Gaspard Deburau.</p><p>He changed his surname to Marceau during the German occupation of France, as a reference to a French revolutionary general.</p><h2><span id=Marcel_Marceau_Movie>Marcel Marceau Movie</span></h2><p>Besides Resistance, Marcel Marceau appeared in several other movies, both as an actor and as a mime.</p><p>Some of his notable roles include:</p><ul><li><a href=#>Barbarella (1968)</a>, a sci-fi adventure film starring Jane Fonda, in which he played Professor Ping, a scientist who helps Barbarella escape from a tyrant.</li><li><a href=#>Silent Movie (1976)</a>, a comedy film directed by Mel Brooks, in which he played himself, and ironically, had the only spoken line in the film: “Non!”</li><li><a href=#>First Class (1979)</a>, a French comedy film directed by Claude Zidi, in which he played a passenger on a chaotic flight.</li><li><a href=#>Shanks (1974)</a>, a horror film directed by William Castle, in which he played Malcolm Shanks, a deaf-mute puppeteer who can animate corpses with electrodes.</li></ul><h2><span id=Marcel_Marceau_Resistance>Marcel Marceau Resistance</span></h2><p>Marcel Marceau was not only a mime, but also a hero.</p><p><strong>During World War II, he joined the French Resistance and helped save hundreds of Jewish children from the Nazis.</strong></p><p>Marcel used his mime skills to disguise himself as a Boy Scout leader, and to calm and entertain the children while they were escaping.</p><p>He also worked as a liaison officer with General George Patton’s Third Army, and once captured 30 German soldiers by pretending to be a French officer.</p><p>He was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Order of Merit, and the Legion of Honor for his bravery and service.</p><img

some of the videos you can find:</p><ul><li><a href=#>The Mask Maker (1959)</a>, one of his classic routines, in which he portrays a man who tries on different masks and becomes possessed by their personalities.</li><li><strong>Bip the Clown</strong>, his most famous character, who wears a striped shirt, a red flower, and a battered hat, and encounters various situations and emotions.</li><li><strong>Pantomime</strong>: The Language of the Heart, a documentary film in which he discusses the art of mime and his character Bip.<br>The Art of Silence, a 12-part series of instructional films in which he teaches the basics of mime, such as movement, expression, and illusion.</li></ul><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>Marcel Marceau was a master of mime, a legend of comedy, and a hero of the Resistance.</p><p>He brought poetry to silence, and joy to millions of people.</p><p>He died in 2007, but his legacy lives on in his films, his school, and his students.</p><p>Marcel once said: “Never get a mime talking. He won’t stop.”</p><p>But perhaps we should listen to what he had to say, without words, through his art.</p><p></p><p>READ ALSO:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifK6t0ZycpWWdlr%2BkscCuZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./netflix-releases-stranger-things-teaser-with-episode-titles.html>&#171;&nbsp;Netflix Releases Stranger Things Teaser With Episode Titles</a>
