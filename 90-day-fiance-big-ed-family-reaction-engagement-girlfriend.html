as a star in 90-day fiancé: The Single Life. However, as he hopes to find love in Kaory, his new partner in the show, he fails again. But with an unexpected turn, one of his ex-partners, Liz Woods, surfaces and shares the spotlight with him towards the show's end, leading to their surprising engagement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all the drama Big Ed gravitates in a short period, is his family still as supportive as they were back when he was with Rose? What does his family think of his brief proposal to Liz? Will we see Big Ed back in the next season of 90-day fiancé in hopes of finding a new partner yet again? Keep reading to find out...</p><h2 id=are-big-ed-and-liz-still-together-2022>Are Big Ed And Liz Still Together 2022?</h2><p><a href=#>Big Ed and Liz's relationship</a> has always been rocky, as fans believe. After <a href=#>Big Ed and Rose broke up</a>, he fell in love with Liz nine months after, but then the two separated ways six months into their relationship. Ed being single again, joined 90-day fiancé: The Single Life but got ghosted by her Mexican ex-partner, Kaory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his struggle to find love, his dog Teddy loses his life which puts the 56-year-old in an emotional state. But Liz enters the picture again and sends him a letter saying her care and condolences. The couple got back together in September 2021, engaged in November of that year, and plan to get married in August 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About '90 Day Fiancé' Big Ed's Rumored Engagement</a></span></p><p>However, fans have been skeptical about the real between them despite their ongoing relationship as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots of Liz's now-deleted Instagram post</a> saying, "I am belittled in creating a lifestyle that will never be me!!

However, Liz has a 7-year-old daughter, Ryleigh, with her ex-partner, while Big Ed also has Tiffany, her 31-year-old daughter.</p><p>Even before the couple gets married, Big Ed already welcomed Ryleigh as his child as part of their small family with Liz.

As Liz is only 30 years old and Tiffany is 31 years old, Tiffany tells his father it makes her uncomfortable that her soon-to-be stepmother is younger than her. Even before her father's engagement with Liz, she has already been vocal about what she feels towards Liz, but Big Ed still pushed through with the engagement nonetheless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from their age gap, Tiffany is also uncomfortable with Big Ed's 'playboy' lifestyle.
