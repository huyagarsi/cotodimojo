"I am constantly looking for ways that I can inspire people to live life with purpose. GAC fits my brand perfectly; we share a vision of creating compelling wholesome content for an audience who wants to watch programming for and with the whole family. Great, quality entertainment with a positive message is what my partnership with GAC is all about!"</p><p>She recently said, in an interview published in Variety, “The truth is, I’ve been under contract with Hallmark for a very, very long time. And those [years] have been absolutely wonderful.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> It just so happened that my contract was expiring when Great American Family started up</a>,” she said. “So we did not start having those discussions until we were well into negotiations with Hallmark Channel for renewing. And as every business person knows, you’ve got to do what’s right for contracts. It didn’t work out with Hallmark and so we started talking to Bill [Abbott].”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-great-american-family-channels><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Is Great American Family Channels?</span></h2><p>Great American Family Channels is a cable television network launched in 1995 as Great American Country.

GAC is said to be a network of "faith and family" and they are less likely to show non-Christian or gay characters. Candace did say that faith was a reason she made the move to the network.</p><p>But Hallmark is a very successful network, so some wonder why she is moving away from them. One reason may be Bill Abbott, who may want to show the type of programming that Bure prefers.</p><p>There are other Hallmark stars that will not move to GAC because it may be non-inclusive.</p><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure-and-her-faith><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Candace Cameron Bure And Her Faith</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Candace has always been vocal about her faith. Her older brother, Kirk Cameron, was also a child star and became an evangelist. He introduced her to religion that resonated with her.</p><p>“My faith is really the foundation of who I am,” she said. “It’s so important to me, and it’s always a part of me, whether it’s at home and privately, or when I’m reading the Bible in Bible study. But also at work, and the choices I make within work, and the companies I choose to work with and the projects that I choose to take on.”</p><p>She encourages her fans to read the bible. She released her One Step Closer Devotional Bible. She says it is easier to read than most bibles.</p><p>Her faith appears to be a big factor in her move to GAC.</p><h2 id=what-is-candace-39-s-first-project-with-gac><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is Candace's First Project With GAC?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Candace Cameron Bure has introduced her first film with Great American Family Channel.
