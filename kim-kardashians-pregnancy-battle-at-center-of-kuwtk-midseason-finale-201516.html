The reality star, 34, revealed that she is pregnant with her second child in a quick teaser for the second half of the season, but the hour before featured the mom of North West, 23 months, visiting multiple fertility clinics to determine when she'd be ovulating.</p><p>Even the terrifying car accident Kim, North, <a href=#><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></a> and <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> were involved in while vacationing in Montana happened as they headed to the airport so Kim could fly back to Los Angeles for a doctor's appointment.</p><p>Read on for the biggest moments from the May 31 episode of the E! reality hit.</p><p><strong>Psychic Energy</strong></p><p>Kim visited a fertility clinic in Montana for more testing, and lamented about her struggle to conceive a sibling for North. "I have done pretty much everything you can do to try and get pregnant," she said. "I'm starting to wonder if it's just easier to give up."&nbsp;</p><p>Later, she confessed to psychic pal John Edward that she'd tried IVF and it didn't work, and he told her to let go of her stress over getting pregnant and direct her energy toward her future child instead. "What you need to do is visualize walking with a child," he advised. "Just know that it's going to happen and just allow it to happen."</p><p><strong>Family Bonding</strong></p><p>The Kardashian kid ski trip vacation to Montana — minus supermodel Kendall Jenner, who was jetsetting to various European fashion engagements, and the still-absent Rob Kardashian — was a positive experience for the family. Scott Disick was in a great mood, aside from a minor road rage incident ("He has been much better but I hope that he sticks with it," <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> said of her boyfriend's behavior), and after a tussle involving Khloe, her BFF Malika, Kim, and her BFF <strong>Jonathan Cheban</strong>, Khloe apologized.</p><p>"Kim and I wanted a positive trip to create new memories. We have so many other huge important things happening in our lives that we don't need to fight over this petty nonsense," Khloe said.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, Khloe thanked her older sister for organizing the jaunt. "I'm so thankful to Kim Kardashian West because without her, this family vaca never would've even happened," she said. Added Scott, "Or our careers!"</p><p><strong>Car Crash&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aforementioned terrifying accident really was scary — as Khloe drove to the airport, a gigantic truck sprayed snow on their black SUV's windshield, causing the car to skid on black ice into oncoming traffic and land in a ditch on the side of the road.</p><p>"It's not my fault," Khloe tried to tell her sisters as she steered into their skid, as Kim screamed in the back seat, "I don't have my seat belt on!"</p><p>Later, after several tearful phone calls (including Kim to husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>), the family made it to their private jet and flew back to California.</p><p><strong>European Vacation</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kris Jenner</strong> took a trip too — to London for the Brit Awards, where she presented a trophy. She took time backstage to catch up with Spice Girl <strong>Mel B</strong>, then traveled on to Paris to visit <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>.</p><p>The mother and daughter caught up over dinner, and Kendall wasn't too pleased when her mom revealed that she planned to head to London Fashion Week. "Why are you following me everywhere? That's my time to get away from home," Kendall exclaimed.</p><p>"My mom wants to make sure everything's perfect but sometimes she just needs to let me do my own thing and live a little," the Calvin Klein and Givenchy model said later.</p><p><strong>Bruce is Home</strong></p><p>Bruce Jenner has lived in many houses over the years, but he was never the only one in charge of a household. Now, striking out on his own at age 65, he has purchased his gorgeous dream home in Malibu.</p><p>"I, at the age of 65, am starting a new chapter in my life," he said, alluding to his gender transition. "I have made some decisions that I'm so excited about but that I'm also nervous about," he said.</p><p>Specifically, he's incredibly happy about his new abode. "This house is actually all mine and I absolutely love it," he confessed.</p><p>When the girls returned from their ski trip, Khloe and Kylie went to visit Bruce for a last glimpse of their dad before he underwent facial feminization surgery. "I'm always going to worry about Bruce," Khloe said, "and no matter what I love him and he will always be my father figure."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>To Be Continued</strong></p><p>The teaser for the second half of KUWTK season 10, coming later in 2015, featured plenty of juicy scenes aside from Kim's pregnancy — it showed the mom-to-be dishing that she'd seen Bruce as "her" and she was "gorgeous," Kris Jenner questioning youngest daughter Kylie about taking birth control, and Khloe flirting on the phone with estranged husband <strong>Lamar Odom</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: What did you think of the KUWTK finale?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpKCmZZuWv6Wt0qGgmqajYr2zscanmKebqWKvosDTpZxmmaRisKa6056pZqeWYri2w9OkZKahlKiyor%2FOp2SfoZ6WuaZ5kWlobmlm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./michael-portillo-net-worth-bio-age-wife-children-siblings-gay-books.html>&#171;&nbsp;Michael Portillo Net Worth Bio, Age, Wife, Children, Siblings, Gay, Books</a>
