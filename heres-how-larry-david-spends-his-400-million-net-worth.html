Additionally, fans know David through his own hit series, Curb Your Enthusiasm. The actor and comedian is slowly but surely becoming the character he played on Curb, however, Larry David doesn't seem to mind in the slightest.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Timothee Chalamet And Larry David Formed An Unlikely Friendship</a></span></p><p>Well, with his many contributions to film and television, it's no shock that the actor has managed to amass a <a href=#>net worth of $400 million!</a> Considering Larry David keeps quite a low profile, many fans wonder what exactly he spends his millions on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on October 13, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Larry David has created two of the greatest comedies in TV history; Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiam. While Seinfeld is no more, Curb has entering its 11th season. With so much success in the biz, many fans wonder what Larry spends his $400 million net worth on. Well, not much! The actor is by no means a big spender, and has barely touched his money earned from HBO. While he enjoyed his golf and fine dining, Larry isn't a big traveler, considering he's a bit of a germaphobe. One thing he does spend his coin on is real estate! David has a few homes throughout California, including his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12 million Pacific Palisades mansion</a>, which he sold back in 2014.</p><h2 id=how-larry-amassed-400-million>How Larry Amassed $400 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's really no point in recapping how Larry David made his epic fortune. Most people know that Seinfeld was insanely successful and continues to make money to this very day. In an interview with BUILD Series, Larry's friend and Curb Your Enthusiasm co-star, J.B. Smoove joked that he hasn't even touched his HBO money yet. He's still enjoying all of that sweet-sweet royalty and syndication money from his years as co-creator and writer on Seinfeld, all which have allowed him to amass <a href=#>his $400 million net worth</a>.</p><p>Prior to Seinfeld and HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry also wrote on Saturday Night Live, Friday's, and a host of other projects, but all of that merely paid his bills. Larry basically went from rags to riches because of Seinfeld. The success of the show has enabled him to take the jobs that HE wants to take, including Curb, a Broadway Show, and various movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also allowed him to spend some serious dollars on luxury items and events, including his many homes, cars, and of course, cigar collection!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Lucy Lawless Really Felt About Working With Larry David</a></span></p><h2 id=larry-has-millions-in-real-estate>Larry Has Millions In Real Estate</h2><p>A man worth $400 million can certainly afford any house he could want. And the truth is, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry has owned quite a few properties</a> over the years. Among them a $12.9 million mansion in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles. The home was especially cool because of the Hobbit-inspired decor. No, the house wasn't directly designed to look like it was part of The Shire; that's more of an unintentional aspect thanks to the Country English style of the property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 7-bedroom, 10-bath home overlooked a golf course which was perfect for Larry as he's an avid golfer. According to an interview on The Rich Eisen Show, Larry has even golfed with former President Barack Obama. But that has nothing to do with his money nor his golf skills. That's more to do with his immense contributions to art and comedy and general connections that come from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being hailed as "a genius"</a>.</p><p>Aside from the Gated Country English estate that he sold years back, according to The LA Times, Larry has also owned another mansion in the Pacific Palisades and property on Martha's Vineyard. The latter has been featured on his daughter, Cazzie David's Instagram feed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=crazy-vacations-and-yachts-aren-39-t-his-thing>Crazy Vacations And Yachts Aren't His Thing</h2><p>Any real fan of Larry David knows that he isn't all that social nor likes to travel, especially when it involves paparazzi following him around. Aside from work, Larry really seems to only travel for two reasons...golf and his daughters. As for yachts and private jets... yeah, no... that's not really Larry's thing. That's far too flashy and ostentatious for him, even though he is worth neatly half a billion dollars and all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About How Larry David Writes His Sitcoms</a></span></p><h2 id=larry-39-s-a-man-of-simple-pleasures-except-for-two-things>Larry's A Man Of Simple Pleasures... Except For Two Things</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the day-to-day, Larry appears to spend money on very healthy and simple foods. Fans know he's a bit of a health nut, but this was confirmed in an interview with GQ. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry's 2020 interview with </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> also shed light on how he spends money on clothing. His personal fashion choice to wear only one piece of expensive clothing at a time. Otherwise, he believes it's just "too much".</p><p>"Too dressed. You have to be half-dressed. That's my fashion theory, since you asked: Half Is More." This perspective is what prompted Jerry Seinfeld to claim that Larry dresses like "an Upper East Side Communist". While his wardrobe and daily menu may not be anything worthy of his $400 million fortune, his car and nightlife surely are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to GQ, Larry drives a Tesla Model S, which is anything but ostentatious in design. However, it does cost over $113,000. Larry also loves a fancy meal at a nice restaurant from time to time. And he gets special treatment when he's there. According to his friend and Curb co-star Richard Lewis, Larry often gets treated with off-the-menu items... and a lot of it!</p><h2 id=the-return-of-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39>The Return Of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'</h2><p>Larry David stopped by Jimmy Kimmels' hit late night talk show to discuss having showed up to Kimmel's birthday party on the wrong day, however, fans were more excited to hear about the return of David's series, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Season 8 had wrapped up in 2011, and fans were gifted season 9 six years later in 2017!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, when season 10 was announced last year, fans hoped that the show would continue on, and well, it is! Season 11 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">premieres at the end of October</a>, and fans cannot wait. With Larry's net worth sitting comfortably at $400 million, it's no surprise that it's only going up from here with more and more seasons of Curb.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Was The Hardest Celebrity For Larry David To Get On 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmo5qqoq56pa3Voptmq6Cau6W%2FjKGgrGVkZX1uucilo6KnnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-pete-davidsons-girlfriend-chase-sui-wonders-say-about-exes-kim-kardashian-and-ariana-grande.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Does Pete Davidson's Girlfriend Chase Sui Wonders Really Feel About His Famous Exes Kim Kardashi</a>
